This page is for both routes, but read before performing.

If you want to be in the safest possible way to sync your Trophies or use your PSN account; you will need to do the following:

### WARNING

PLEASE NOTE: NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO. IT WILL NEVER BE SAFE 100%. DO IT ON YOUR OWN RISK. YOU MAY BE BANNED BY USING SYNCING YOUR TROPHIES OR USING YOUR PSN ACCOUNT. THE WAY I AM SHOWING IS TO BE AS SAFEST AS POSSIBLE.

- Click [here](#cfw) if your PS3 has CFW installed.
- Click [here](#hen) if your PS3 has HEN installed.

# CFW

There are two options when you want to use anything that's related to PSN.

## 1. Removing sysCalls

This way, your PS3 will stay the same but you can't use any homebrew apps and play your backup games.
1. Go to "webMANMOD"
2. Press and hold the **R2, and /\** (Traingle) at the same time.

### Trophies Tools

Obtain the trophies by playing the game fairly as Trophies tools and suspicious time stamps may ban you.

## 2. DualBoot (CEX Only)

This way, your PS3 will be in OFW but can be reverted to CFW by updating normally. Note that the OFW that you will install is modified (No need to flash your console again), meaning it's still not 100% safe.

- Note that this way is only for PS3s with CEX firmware installed.
1. Download OFW from this [page.](https://www.psx-place.com/threads/littlebalups-4-91-dual-boot-firmwares.39799/)
2. Update via Storage Media like a normal PS3 update.
- Now you will be in a "OFW", if you want to return to CFW, basically install CFW again via Storage Media.


# HEN

The best way to be safe is just don't enable HEN.

### Trophies Tools

Obtain the trophies by playing the game fairly as Trophies tools and suspicious time stamps may ban you.
