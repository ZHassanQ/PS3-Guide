## 📀 PlayStation 1

All PS3’s are capable of playing 100% of PS1 games with No problem at all, you can even dump them if you want like a PS3 game.

- You can dump PS1 games like PS3 games. By multiMAN “Once a time” method.

But if you already dumped a PS1 game then you can easily copy it like this: 

- I will use “CTR - Crash Team Racing” as an example.

**On your Computer:**

1. Put **"CTR - Crash Team Racing.bin"** and **"CTR - Crash Team Racing.cue"** files in: `USB:PSXISO\CTR - Crash Team Racing` folder.

- You can use this method for ISO files.
- To change the game’s icon put the icon in `USB:PSXISO\CTR - Crash Team Racing` folder and rename it exactly like the game name.
- All the files: **".bin, .cue, .iso, & icon"** must share the same exact name. (The folder is also included)

2. Transfer the files in your own way to `dev_hdd0\PSXISO`

## 💿 PlayStation 2 

Some PS3’s are capable of emulating 100% of PS2 games as they contain PS2 hardware. And they are the “Backwards Compatible PHAT” PS3’s. Other models can emulate a pretty good number of PS2 games you can this **[list](https://www.psdevwiki.com/ps3/PS2_Classics_Emulator_Compatibility_List)** to see your game’s compatibility.

- You can dump PS2 games like PS3 games. By multiMAN “Once a time” method.

But if you already dumped a PS2 game then you can easily copy it like this: 

- I will use “Silent Hill 2” as an example.

**On your Computer:**

1. Put **"Silent Hill 2.bin"** and **"Silent Hill 2.cue"** files in: `USB:PS2ISO\Silent Hill 2` folder.

- You can use this method for ISO files.
- To change the game’s icon put the icon in `USB:PS2ISO\Silent Hill 2` folder and rename it exactly like the game name.
- All the files: **".bin, .cue, .iso, & icon"** must share the same exact name. (The folder is also included)

2. Transfer the files in your own way to `dev_hdd0\PS2ISO`

### Encode (HEN)

If you're on HEN you need to encode any PS2 game you want to play. You can simply do that with **Apollo Save Tools.** 


## 💽 PlayStation Portable

Sadly all the PSP emulation on PS3 isn't like PS2 games, you can this **[list](https://www.psdevwiki.com/ps3/PSP_Emulator_Compatibility_List)** for more information about game's compatibility.

- I will use “Exit” as an example.

**On your Computer:**

1. Put **"Exit.iso"** file in: `USB:PSPISO\Exit` folder. (You can put the iso file in `USB:\PSPISO`, the icon is included.)

- To change the game’s icon put the icon in `USB:PSPISO\Exit` folder and rename it exactly like the game name.
- All the files: **".bin, .cue, .iso, & icon"** must share the same exact name. (The folder is also included)

2. Transfer the files in your own way to `dev_hdd0\PSPISO`

## 💾 Other Consoles

You can use RetroArch to emulate other consoles that are older, and/or weaker than PS2. As the PS3 doesn't really emulate the PS2 100%, it already contains some PS2 hardware. You can see this **[post](https://www.psx-place.com/threads/retroarch-ps3-guide-2018-wip.17119/)** for more information about RetroArch and RetroArch Community Edition.
